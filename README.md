# ICS3U1 Culminating

## Features

This project originally was meant to be a game engine but I realized that it would be unrealistic to finish everything I wanted to add  by the time that I started. So for now I decided to use what I already had and make something "simple" like the mandelbrot set.

## Libraries needed
* [LWJGL](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/releases/tag/3.3.1) Graphics library + extra features
* [JOML](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML/releases/tag/1.10.5) Math library


## Features

* Key Listener
* Mouse Listener
* Scene Manager
* Window Manager
* Shader class
* Time system

## Scenes

* MandelBrot set (just your everyday fractal)

## Future Mechanics

* Camera
* Texture Loading
* Entities
* Batch Rendering system
* Texture Batching system
* Spritesheet Support
* Proper Gui
* Serialization/Deserialization
* More utility function
* Framebuffers
* Physics
* Animations

## Future Fixes

* Better scroll (currently zooms into the center in a weird way)
* Slow rendering
* Anything else that I find while implementing new features..
